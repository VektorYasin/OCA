	 * 80. Which two features can be implemented in a Java application
	 * by encapsulating the entity classes used?
(Choose two.)
C. data hiding
D. data abstraction

Answer: C D
	 Data hiding:
	 Encapsulating the entity classes enables you to hide the internal
	 implementation details and data of the class from external access.
	 This helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing direct
	 modification of class fields, ensuring controlled access through
	 methods.

	 Data abstraction:
	 Encapsulating the entity classes allows you to provide a simplified
	 and abstracted view of the data and its operations.
	 By exposing only the necessary methods and hiding the implementation
	 details, you achieve data abstraction, which focuses on what the data
	 does rather than how it is implemented
